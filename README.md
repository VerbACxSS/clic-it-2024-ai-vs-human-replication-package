## Abstract
This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in simplifying Italian administrative texts compared to human informants. This research evaluates the performance of several well-known LLMs, including *GPT-3.5-Turbo*, *GPT-4*, *LLaMA 3*, and *Phi 3*, in simplifying a corpus of Italian administrative documents (*s-ItaIst*), a representative corpus of Italian administrative texts. To accurately compare the simplification abilities of humans and LLMs, six parallel corpora of a subsection of ItaIst are collected. These parallel corpora were analyzed using both complexity and similarity metrics to assess the outcomes of LLMs and human participants. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform comparably to humans in many aspects, there are notable differences in structural and semantic changes. The results of our study underscore the potential and limitations of using AI for administrative text simplification, highlighting areas where LLMs need improvement to achieve human-level proficiency.


## Experimental design
![Experimental design schema: The s-ItaIst corpus was simplified both automatically and manually by two humans and four LLMs. The resulting parallel corpora were analyzed using complexity and similarity metrics.](experimental_design/experimental_design.png "Experimental design schema")


## Setup
Create a virtual environment
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Replication Package Content
* `s_itaist_corpus`: folder that contains the original documents of the s-ItaIst corpus
  * `{document_id}.pdf`: original document
  * `{document_id}.md`: extracted texts
* `simplified_corpora`: folder that contains all the s-ItaIst parallel corpora. Each .csv file contains:
  * `document`: document identifier
  * `paragraph_index`: sequential number in relation to the original document
  * `original_text`: plain text of the original paragraph
  * `simplified_text`: plain text of the simplified paragraph
* `automatic_simplifier.py` and `utils`: the code employed to automatically simplify the s-ItaIst. It requires `OPEN_AI_KEY` and a modern GPU with al least 12GB VRAM.
* `exec_readit.py`: script to launch read-it jobs (must be executed before `metrics_extractor.py`).
* `metrics_extractor.py`: script to extract metrics from each parallel corpus. It employs [italian-ats-evaluator](https://github.com/RedHitMark/italian-ats-evaluator).
* `metrics_overview.ipynb`: jupyter notebook used to summarize the metrics on parallel corpora.
* `metrics_statistical_analysis.ipynb`: jupyter notebook used to perform the statistical analysis described in the paper.
